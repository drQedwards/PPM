pmll_mcp — PMLL (Persistent Memory Logic Loop) exposed as an MCP tool.

Adapted from pufferlib/PMLL.py (drQedwards/PufferLib PR #1) for use with PPM.
This package wraps PMLL's MemoryController and Q-promise chain into a
Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so that AI agents can call PMLL
operations as tools.
